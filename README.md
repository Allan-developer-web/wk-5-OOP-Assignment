# Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️
The assignment demonstrates:

1. Attributes (brand, model, _storage, gpu)
2. Methods (call, play_game, get_storage, set_storage)
3. Constructor for initialization
4. Encapsulation (private _storage with getter/setter)
5. Inheritance & Polymorphism (GamingSmartphone extends Smartphone)

# Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭
Explanation:

1. Each subclass (Car, Plane, Boat) overrides the move() method to show polymorphism.
2. Running the program prints a unique movement for each vehicle.
